# Contributing

To contribute to `faster-games/ui-components` here are some things you'll want to know:

+ `Documentation~\scripts\generate-docs.ps1` can be used to re-generate `docfx` docs
+ Min-supported Unity version is documented in `package.json`
+ `.gitattributes` should force `LF` endings

Other than that, we use a normal fork and PR process to contribute! Feel free to send a PR, or open an Issue to discuss approaches.
