The new Unity UI Toolkit provides a browser-like way to create UI in Unity Games. However, this core set of tools doesn't come with much. As a result, I wanted to create a set of primitives I could reuse to reduce boilerplate. This is that set.

## Installing

This package supports [openupm](https://openupm.com/packages/com.faster-games.ui-components/) - you can install it using the following command:

```
openupm add com.faster-games.ui-components
```

Or by adding directly to your `manifest.json`:

> Note: You may also use specific versions by appending `#{version}` where version is a [Release tag](https://github.com/faster-games/ui-components/releases) - e.g. `#v1.2.0`.

```
dependencies: {
	...
	"com.faster-games.ui-components": "git+https://github.com/faster-games/ui-components.git"
}
```

Or by using [Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) to "Add a package from Git URL", using the following url:

```
